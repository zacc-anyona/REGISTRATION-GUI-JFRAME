# REGISTRATION-GUI-JFRAME
In this project i have created a simple rgistration form using java GUI JFRAME to take user details. It creates a MYSQL server if not avaible and saves the user's details to it.
It also has a reset buttton that clears all the detals entered by the user so that the next user can enter their details
There is a small screen on the right that when the user submits their details it displays to the user the credetials they have just entered 
Remember the user must first accept the terms and conditions for their details to be uploaded to the database.
